# drink_list

## Description
This is a repository for the development of software for keeping track of drink ingredients and recipes. It keeps a list of drinks and their ingredients and recipes, as well as a bar inventory, and can use this information to calculate which drinks can be made in the bar, and how many. It can also be used to consume ingredients from the bar inventory depending on which drinks have been drunk.
